    * See Content Block Information
    *
    * > Use this endpoint to call information for your existing [Content Blocks](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/content_blocks/).
    *
    *
    * To use this endpoint, you’ll need to generate an API key with the `content_blocks.info` permission.
    *
    * **Note:** If you are using our [older navigation](https://www.braze.com/docs/navigation), `content_block_id`can be found at ****Developer Console** > **API Settings****.
    *
    * ### Rate limit
    *
    * We apply the default Braze rate limit of 250,000 requests per hour to this endpoint, as documented in [API rate limits](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/).
    *
    * ### Response
    *
    * ``` json
    * Content-Type: application/json
    * Authorization: Bearer YOUR_REST_API_KEY
    * {
    *   "content_block_id": "string",
    *   "name": "string",

    * ## Troubleshooting
    *
    * The following table lists possible returned errors and their associated troubleshooting steps.
    *
    * | Error | Troubleshooting |
    * | --- | --- |
    * | `Content Block ID cannot be blank` | Make sure that a Content Block is listed in your request and is encapsulated in quotes (`""`). |
    * | `Content Block ID is invalid for this App Group` | This Content Block doesn't exist or is in a different company account or app group. |
    * | `Content Block has been deleted—content not available` | This Content Block, though it may have existed earlier, has been deleted. |
    * | `Include Inclusion Data—error` | This parameter only accepts boolean values (true or false). Make sure the value for `include_inclusion_data` is not encapsulated in quotes (`""`), which causes the value to be sent as a string instead. See [request parameters](#request-parameters) for details. |
