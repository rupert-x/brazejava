    * Send Canvas Messages via API Triggered Delivery
    *
    * > Use this endpoint to send Canvas messages via API-triggered delivery.
    *
    *
    * To use this endpoint, you’ll need to generate an API key with the `canvas.trigger.send` permission.
    *
    * API-triggered delivery allows you to house message content inside of the Braze dashboard while dictating when a message is sent, and to whom via your API.
    *
    * Note that to send messages with this endpoint, you must have a [Canvas ID](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/identifier_types/#canvas-api-identifier) created when you build a Canvas.
    *
    * ## Rate limit
    *
    * When specifying a segment or Connected Audience in your request, we apply a rate limit of 250 requests per minute to this endpoint. Otherwise, if specifying an `external_id`, this endpoint has a default rate limit of 250,000 requests per hour, as documented in [API rate limits](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/).
    *
    * Braze endpoints support [batching API requests](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/#batching-api-requests). A single request to the messaging endpoints can reach any of the following:
    *
    * - Up to 50 specific `external_ids`, each with individual message parameters
    * - A segment of any size created in the Braze dashboard, specified by its `segment_id`
    * - An ad-hoc audience segment of any size, defined in the request as a [Connected Audience](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/connected_audience/) object
    *
    *
    * ## Request parameters
    *
    * | Parameter | Required | Data Type | Description |
    * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    * | `canvas_id` | Required | String | See [Canvas identifier](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/identifier_types/). |
    * | `canvas_entry_properties` | Optional | Object | See [Canvas entry properties](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/canvas_entry_properties_object/). Personalization key-value pairs that will apply to all users in this request. The Canvas entry properties object has a maximum size limit of 50 KB. |
    * | `broadcast` | Optional | Boolean | You must set `broadcast` to true when sending a message to an entire segment that a campaign or Canvas targets. This parameter defaults to false (as of August 31, 2017).  <br>  <br>If `broadcast` is set to true, a recipients list cannot be included. However, use caution when setting `broadcast: true`, as unintentionally setting this flag may cause you to send your message to a larger than expected audience. |
    * | `audience` | Optional | Connected audience object | See [Connected audience](https://braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/connected_audience/). |
    * | `recipients` | Optional | Array | See [Recipients object](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/recipient_object/). If not provided and `broadcast` is set to true, the message will send to the entire segment targeted by the Canvas.  <br>  <br>The `recipients` array may contain up to 50 objects, with each object containing a single `external_user_id` string and `canvas_entry_properties` object. Either `external_user_id` or user_alias is required for this call. Requests must specify only one.  <br>  <br>When `send_to_existing_only` is true, Braze will only send the message to existing users—however this flag can’t be used with user aliases. When `send_to_existing_only` is `false` and a user with the given `id` does not exist, Braze will create a user with that ID and attributes before sending the message. |
    *
    * Customers using the API for server-to-server calls may need to whitelist the appropriate API URL if they’re behind a firewall.
    *
    * > **Note:** If you include both specific users in your API call and a target segment in the dashboard, the message will send to specifically the user profiles that are in the API call and qualify for the segment filters.
    *
    *
    * ## Response details
    *
    * Message sending endpoint responses will include the message’s `dispatch_id` for reference back to the dispatch of the message. The `dispatch_id` is the ID of the message dispatch (unique ID for each “transmission” sent from the Braze platform). Check out [Dispatch ID behavior](https://www.braze.com/docs/help/help_articles/data/dispatch_id/) for more information.
    *
    * ## Create send endpoint
    *
    * **Using the Attributes Object in Canvas**
    *
    * Braze has a Messaging Object called `Attributes` that allows you to add, create, or update attributes and values for a user before sending them an API-Triggered Canvas using the `canvas/trigger/send` endpoint as this API call will process the User Attributes object before it processes and sends the Canvas. This helps minimize the risk of there being issues caused by [race conditions](https://www.braze.com/docs/help/best_practices/race_conditions/).
    *
    * > **Important:** Looking for the camaigns version of this endpoint? Check out [Sending campaign messages via API-triggered delivery](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/messaging/send_messages/post_send_triggered_campaigns/).
    *
    * POST /canvas/trigger/send
